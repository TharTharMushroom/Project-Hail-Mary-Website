            <h3>What is the Hail Mary Mission?</h3>
            <p>
                Our sun is running out of energy because of Astrophage, and the Earth is in dire condition until this is rectified. The world's greatests scientests came together to give this planet a chance. The Hail Mary Mission is a one-way suicide mission on which three astronauts will investigate the star Tau Ceti to figure out why it is not affected by the Astrophage infestation. These brave astronauts will send the research they conduct back to Earth using revolutionary Beetle technology, which may be the only way to figure out how to prevent the sun from dimming.

            <h3>What are astrophage?</h3>
            <p>
                Astrophage are single-celled alien organisms that consume the energy of stars, which causes them to cool and dim, which is why they are named after the Greek word for "star-eater".
